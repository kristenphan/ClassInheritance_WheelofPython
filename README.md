If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
